[Bridgeman](README.md) Road Map

Some of the more epic features we'd like to incorporate into the site include:

  - News aggregation from a variety of sources (i.e. Google News)
  - Comments on news summaries
  - Search (i.e. Google)
    - All
    - Subheadings
  - Q and A (i.e. Stack Overflow)
  - Alumni (Tweets, news and other stuff about famous alumni)
  - Rivals (Light news about new and historical rivals)
  - Editorials (This could be a blog or something more which would allow contributions from outsiders)
  - Stats (I've always loved @RealCardGame posts on twitter.  Would like to consolidate these _with proper attribution_ somehow)
  - Tweet Toasts (Find patterns in tweets and show the important ones in a toast message.  Ignore irrelevant tweets)
  - Chat
  - Message Boards (Maybe.  Its kind of been done, but then again, to foster community it might be necessary)
