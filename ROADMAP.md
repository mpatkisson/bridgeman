# [Bridgeman](README.md) Road Map

Some of the more epic features we'd like to incorporate into the site include:

## News aggregation from a variety of sources

Should be something like Google news for the specific university.

## Comments on news summaries

Should be something like, but more modern than slashdot.org commentary on news
summaries.

## Search

Should allow users to search for anything the site archives or by facet.

## Q and A (i.e. Stack Overflow)

Should allow questions to be raised and answered with a point or reputation
system.

## Artwork

A gallery of my own university related art as well as contributions from others.
Wallpapers, skins, logos ... that sort of thing.

## Alumni

Tweets, news and other stuff about famous alumni.

## Rivals

Light news about new and historical rivals.

## Editorials

This could be a blog or something more which would allow contributions from
outsiders.  It's really just a place for me to voice my own thoughts about big
events.

## Stats

I've always loved @RealCardGame stat tweets.  I would like to consolidate
these _with proper attribution and permission_ somehow.

## Tweet Toasts

Find patterns in tweets and show the important ones in a toast message.  Ignore
irrelevant tweets.  Provide links to the actual tweets.

## Chat

Chat boards might be a nice touch if they could be done safely.

## Message Boards
Maybe.  Its kind of been done, but then again, to foster community it might be
helpful.
